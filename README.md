# CS146_ClassProjects

This repository contains class projects from my CS 146 Data Structures and Algorithms class.

Project 1: Data Shuffling and Circular Linked List
- Wrote a script in Java to read an input file, shuffle its data using the Fisher–Yates algorithm, and print the shuffled data into an output file
- Wrote a script in Java that takes input values for n and k, creates a doubly linked circular linked list containing n nodes, deletes every kth node starting from the head and returns the last remaining node
- Used JUnits to write test cases for the code

Project 2: Max-Subarray
- Wrote a script in Java that takes a given an array of integers, uses brute force, Divide and Conquer as well as Kadane’s algorithm to return the subarray with the maximum sum.
- Used JUnits to write test cases for the code

Project 3: Maze Navigation
- Developed a script in Java to create any n x n maze with a guaranteed solution from start to end, such that there is only one way of reaching any cell from the starting cell.
- The algorithm utilizes a graph to represent the connections between cells, and also uses breadth-first search and depth-first search in order to find the solution.

Project 4: Red-Black Tree
- Wrote a script in Java to create a dictionary implemented as a red-black tree and then use the dictionary to spell-check the words of a document
- Used JUnits to write test cases for the code
